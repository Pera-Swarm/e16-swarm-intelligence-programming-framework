## Abstract

This will be part of the larger [PeraSwarm]('https://pera-swarm.ce.pdn.ac.lk) project. It currently have a robotic multi-agent systems testbed with different types of robot hardware, virtual robots and a simulation environment. This particular project will focus on building a high-level programming and compiler framework which can be used to "write" or "draw" algorithms and convert them into low-level code. The framework will support multiple different types of robot hardware (both real and virtual).

## Related works

- Programming paradigms that abstract the lower level functionalities of the hardware. 
- Different frameworks implemented for swarm drones.
- Swarm UI frameworks having codeless approaches. 
- A modular framework that supports limited architectures of hardware called EmSBot.
- EmSBot Script : A smaller virtual machine based software framework for addressing most challenging aspects in programming swarms robots.
